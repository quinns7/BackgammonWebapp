## Project Deliverable One 

Team Names
I would encourage you to be creative in selecting a team name. If you aren't sure what name to pick, my suggestion would be to go with an animal.

Team Agreement
The goal of this document is to get everyone on the same page with regards to how the team will get work accomplished.

This is a living document. Put it somewhere that all team members can easily access it. Then add things, change things, and clarify things as needed.

Here are my suggestions regardings things that you should cover in this document.

What tools will you use for communication? Slack? Discord? Email? Group Text Messages? Carrier Pidgeons?
How often do you expect each person to check project related messages? If you ask a question, when should you expect a response? Are there hours of the day when messages should not be sent?
How do you keep track of who is working on what task? Trello? Some other kanban board? Assigning GitHub Issues? Something else? (Note: Two is often a good number of people to assign to a task.)
It is vital that every decision the group makes is recorded. (If something isn't recorded, it hasn't been decided.) How/Where does your group record decisions?
I highly recommend that you use short Standup meetings multiple times a week to check in on progress. When will these standup meetings take place. (Remember: Don't solve problems at Stand-up meetings, just check in and if there is an issue assign a couple people to discuss it in between meetings.)
When will you block out time for longer meetings when you have larger issues to discuss among all team members. (Note: My advice is to use these meetings primarily for big-picture design questions.)
... I am sure there is something else that I forgot ...
Initial Project Topic
I would like you to select a project within one of two broad categories. I am pushing you towards thsese two categories because I believe they can each be decomposed into a set of small microservices and that they lend themselves to interesting design decisions. That is, these two categories are both vehicles through which you can have the educational experiences that I want you to have in this class.

Category 1: Algorithm Testbed/Scoreboard A colleague of mine now works for a company that asks job candidates to implement an optimization algorithm for a cool problem that is related to the company's work. My colleague therefore built a testbed that allowed them to accept code from arbitrary individuals and run the code on some of the company's proprietary data to evaluate the job candidate's solution. This also lends itself naturally to a scoreboard and friendly competition among folks already working for the company. If your team did this style of project, you would pick a cool algorithmic problem and then create a framework/testbed for evaluating/scoring algorithmic solutions to the problem.

If your group selects this option, you should begin brainstorming an algorithmic problem to focus on.

You could pick a famous problem, like traveling salesman or integer knapsack
You could pick a problem that came up in another class
You could pick something random like how to assign students to final project groups while minimizing unhappiness. (Which is a problem that has been on my mind recently for some reason)
Category 2: Implementing a turn-based game Games provide an enjoyable way to stretch your skills in software design. If your team took this approach, you could implement any board game, or something like Tetris, or a game show (or trivia game). You would provide a framework for players to play each other or to play against AI opponents. (A well-designed framework would make it easy for anyone to add new AI opponents). Additionally, you could keep track of past results; you could let players re-watch their friends games the next day, or you could let friends compete on a score board to achieve the highest rank. There is a lot of flexibility here depending on the game that you pick and the directions your team wants to take the project.

If your group selects this option, you should begin brainstorming a game to focus on.

I highly recommend that you avoid games with real-time input from the player. (This introduces a LOT of additional complexity)
You could do something like Tetris which has time advancing slowly in discrete steps. (In essence, Tetris gives the player an opportunity to make a move each time step and if the player doesn't move, then the piece just falls straight down one unit.)
You could do essentially any board game
You could do essentially any game show or any style of trivia competition
