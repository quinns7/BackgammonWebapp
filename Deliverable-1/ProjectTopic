Project idea:

Playing a game of Backgammon online, either with an AI or with another player.

MVP:

Text print the board. Each token is denoted by a number, type in which column to play in and which token to move. a random number generator prints the dice roll. Simple AI moves wherever it can, whichever move it sees first (greedy algorithm).  

Later On: 

From typing in the move to clicking a token 
Playing on separate screens
Graphics instead of text printing 

Organizational Structure 

Database (SQL):
Wins vs losses for each username logged in the system
(just hardcode for basic infrastructure)
Backend (Flask and Python):
AI strategy file (think Alice)
Game state (think AssignmentOne.py)
Frontend (HTML? Vue?)
Printing board
Getting information from user

File structure

SQL database setup
Game logic
AI logic
Api endpoints
Frontendâ€¦
