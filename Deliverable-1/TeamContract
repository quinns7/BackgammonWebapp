What tools will you use for communication?
We have a Slack set up for communication, and this will be our principle tool used to talk about the project.

How often do you expect each person to check project related messages? 
At least once a day, and have the Slack workspace on your phone so that you can get notifications when someone has said something. 

If you ask a question, when should you expect a response? 
Within the same day, unless it is marked ‘Urgent’, in which case one of us should try to respond within an hour or two. 

Are there hours of the day when messages should not be sent? 
Do not expect a response between 10pm and 8am, although you can send messages during those hours. 

How do you keep track of who is working on what task? 
We have a Trello board to keep track of tasks, assignments, todos etc. This should be kept up to date: tasks should have people assigned to them, they should show the status of the task (to do, in progress, done). “Backlog” is tasks not assigned to anyone yet, things people can pick from if they need something to do. “To do” should be tasks of higher priority than the backlog, all those tasks should be assigned to someone. Then update the status of the task by moving it to “in progress”, “to be merged”, and finally “finished”

How/Where does your group record decisions? 
We have a shared document to record group decisions. We will have bi-/tri-weekly stand-up meetings, with weekly longer meetings when necessary, and will take notes during those meetings. 

When will these standup meetings take place? 
Mondays at 8pm and Saturdays at 3pm, and Wednesdays at 8pm if there is no team meeting that day. 

When will you block out time for longer meetings when you have larger issues to discuss among all team members? 
Wednesdays from 7-9pm, and we might schedule times during the weekend if we need another meeting that week. 

Standup guidelines:
- On Zoom
- Max 10 min, goal 5 min
- Each person gives progress update
- Assign people to help/new tasks as needed
- Nothing needs to be resolved. It is a space to figure out who needs to talk to each other to get things done, or figure out what issues we have

Meeting guidelines:
- In person
- Progress updates
- Brainstorm problem solutions, work on code 
- Make team decisions, decide code structure etc

GitHub guidelines:
- We start with a simple working mock-up
- Then work in branches out from this mock-up
- Have descriptive commit messages
- ONLY COMMIT TO MAIN IF YOU ARE SURE THAT YOUR BRANCH WORKS
- Use squash and merge with a commit message describing the feature of your branch
- Get someone to review your branch before committing
